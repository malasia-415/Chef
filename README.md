 Who is this project for?
As a developer, your goal is not just to build something that works, but to build something that works and that people want to use. This is true whether youâ€™re building a new social media product or internal tools at a large company. Capstone projects exist for you to gain experience doing exactly that.

There are 2 primary audiences that you need to keep in mind as you design and build your capstone. The first, and most important, is always the user. As you make decisions about the scope of your project (i.e. what features to include) you need to consider what's most important to the person using the site, which might not be the same as what's most interesting to you as the developer.

The other key audience to keep in mind is prospective employers. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to help you get hired as a web developer. That means thinking about what type of projects and designs will stand out to hiring managers.
